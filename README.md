#  My Wardrobe – Smart Outfit & Shopping Assistant

 **Microsoft Imagine Cup 2025 – Student MVP Project**

My Wardrobe is a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** built by **first-year engineering students** to explore how technology can simplify outfit selection and reduce impulsive shopping using a digital wardrobe concept.

This project focuses on **idea validation, user experience, and core functionality**, rather than a fully scaled backend system.

##  Problem Statement
Many students and working professionals struggle with:
- Choosing outfits daily
- Lack of fashion knowledge
- Buying clothes they already have similar alternatives for

This leads to wasted money, unused clothing, and decision fatigue.

---

##  Proposed Solution
**My Wardrobe** introduces a simple digital wardrobe that helps users:
- Organize their clothes digitally
- Get quick outfit suggestions
- Decide whether buying a new clothing item is actually necessary

*Note:* This is an **MVP**, built to demonstrate the concept and user flow.

##  Microsoft Imagine Cup Context
This project is developed as part of the **Microsoft Imagine Cup**, with the goal of:
- Solving a real-world problem faced by students
- Demonstrating a practical MVP
- Showcasing product thinking, not a full-scale production system

As **first-year students**, the focus is on:
- Learning real-world development workflows
- Building a functional prototype
- Understanding user needs and product design

---

##  Limitations (Current MVP)
- Limited backend complexity
- No advanced AI or ML models yet
- Basic recommendation logic
- Designed for demonstration and validation purposes

---

## Future Improvements
- AI-based color & style detection
- Smarter outfit recommendations
- Price comparison across online stores
- Celebrity-inspired outfit recreation
- Personalized fashion insights
